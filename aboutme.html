      <h3> I love little Mary's poem </h3>

            Mary had a little lamb,
            Little lamb, little lamb,
            Mary had a little lamb,
            Its fleece was white as snow,
            And every where that Mary went,
            Mary went, Mary went,
            Everywhere that Mary went,
            The lamb was sure to go;
            He followed her to school one day,
            School one day, school one day,
            He followed her to school one day,
          <br />
        
          <br />
          Which was against the rule;
          It made the children laugh and play,
          Laugh and play, laugh and play,
          It made the children laugh and play,
          To see a lamb at school,
          And so the teacher turned him out,
          Turned him out, turned him out,
          So the teacher turned him out,
          But still he lingered near,
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="p2">
        <p>
            And waited patiently about,
            Patiently about, patiently about,
            Waited patiently about,
            Till Mary did appear;
            ‚ÄúWhy does the lamb love Mary so?
            Mary so, Mary so,
            Why does the lamb love Mary so?‚Äù
            The eager children cried;
          <br />
          <br />
          ‚ÄúWhy Mary loves the lamb, you know,
          Lamb you know, lamb you know,
          Why Mary loves the lamb, you know‚Äù
          The teacher did reply;
          Mary had a little lamb,
          Little lamb, little lamb,
          Mary had a little lamb,
          Its fleece was white as snow.
